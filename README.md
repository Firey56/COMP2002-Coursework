# COMP2002 Coursework
 
## Part 1: Machine Learning

### 1.1: Data Preparation
The data must be normalized and split into training and testing data.

### 1.2: Regression
Implementation of the regressors for:
 - Random Forest
 - Neural Network
 - Support Vector Machine
 The packages used will be referenced at the end of the readme
 
 ### 1.3: Assessment of Regression
 The regression models are being cross referenced using scikit-learn using cross validation. They are being judged on the mean squared error.
